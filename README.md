# Parkie 🅿️
## Private Building Parkade Manager Mobile App 🚗

Many car owners find City / public parking too expensive and restrictive, especially in downtown and sub-centers.  Many residential buildings have very limited visitor parking spots and many unused private spots.  For many global investors who have purchased apartments with parking spots as an investment, their renters might not have cars.  That leaves their parking spots empty for most of the year.  These foreign investors are unaware that there is an opportunity to earn extra income to pay for the $25-40,000 parking lot they purchased.

The application would allow parking spot owners to lease their spot and parking spot users to rent one for themselves or their visitors in a safe, timely, hassle-free system. It’s challenging to find a conveniently-located, safe and value priced parking spot in downtown or in other sub-centers of the city.

### 💡 The following main features will help to solve the problems/offer opportunities:
+ Users can find conveniently-located, value-priced and safe parking spots in reputable buildings as an alternative to public parkades and street parking.
- The parking spot renter can pre-book, rent on the spot, or cancel reservations.  
+ A chat messaging system allows users to chat with parking spot owners to get more details of the building, access schedules, security and payment processing.
+ iOS/Android components - push notifications, geolocation, and camera (i.e. verify car condition, report damage, recognize license plate number).
+ Cloud security components - Apple/Google authentication/Firestore/MySQL/GraphQL database.
